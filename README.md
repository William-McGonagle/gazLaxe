## What is `GazLAxe`
`GazLAxe` is an open source hacking tool that utilizes UI standards that have been brought about in our modern day. It allows an everyday user to protect themselves against hackers, scammers and everyday exploiters. `GazLAxe` also allows security options for your computer, such as allowing you to change your IP address, password, and username at will, even if you are not running `GazLAxe` on those platforms.

- [ ] Agent Smith
  - _Gives the user control over a certain amount of computers. A script can be transfered to all of these computers that makes them check a webserver for instructions every X amount of minutes. Other methods of swarm control can also be given to all of these computers._
- [ ] Network Manager
  - _Get detailed information about everyone on your network. Works very similar to ARP, but custom ports can be used for the pinging so even computers with certain ports blocked can be pinged._
  - _This works by checking users local IP Address and then replacing the end segment with a number from 1 to 255, and then this IP address is pinged on port 22 or whatever port the user wants. It iterates this 255 times until all possible hosts are found. Custom template addresses can also be used so that the user is able to scan for public IP addresses if they perfer._
- [ ] Mr. Map
  - _Essentially NMap for GazLAxe. Does everything that NMAP can do, but with a UI._
